* phpBB versions: 3.1
* Author: [Vjacheslav Trushkin](http://www.phpbb.com/community/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5926)

## PROGRESS

Progress updated on 08 Oct 2011

I've postponed this until phpBB 3.1.0 beta. It requires way too much effort to implement it for phpBB 3.0 that will soon be replaced with 3.1, so for now I'll stick to developing prosilver based styles.

## BRANCHES

* Master: includes only templates and global javascript files
* Theme/: includes all css files, images and theme specific javascript files

## LICENSE

[Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Why not GPL? Apache license allows style authors to use this framework for commercial styles. I think allowing creation of commercial styles will benefit phpBB community.
